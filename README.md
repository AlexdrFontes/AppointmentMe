AppointmentMe is an API developed to record an appointment for a especific date and be reminded about that event.

This simple API covers the following topic of Ruby on Rails:

* App created without views, can be called with a REST client;

* Mailler integration with SendGrid;

For using and testing I would advise you to use the Insomnia REST Client.
